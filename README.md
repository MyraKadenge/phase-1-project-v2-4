# Phase 1 Project Description and findings
A. Overview
Microsoft is a multinational technological company. 
As a private company and knowing that they want to open a new studio, their main concern should not only be generating  profits. This hence poses a challenge for the company which is to figure out how to open a profitable studio and explore the films that are currently doing the best, or considered most popular. The most essential thing to do would be to look at the most profitable movies.

B. Business Understanding
Microsoft  aims at making a significaant entrance in the world of entertainment with its ambitious entry into the film industry. Recognizing the transformative power of  original content and the growing demand for diverse storytelling, micrsoft has decided to open its own new studio.
This underscores Microsoftâ€™s commitment to innovation and desire to engage audiences in new and exciting ways.
Microsoft aims to leverage business insights to produce compelling films that captivate audiences.

C. Key business questions would be;
1. Which genre is the most popular and most played by the audiences?
2. Which studios are the most profitable? This question would help  Microsoft set a benchmark for themselves on how to operate their studio. or even help microsoft consider which studio to partner with for a short period before starting their own studio.
3. Does the run time affect the profits?
4. Is there a correlation between the revenues and the popularity?


D. Data Understanding and Analysis
We have collected several datasets containing valuable information related to the movie industry, including data on box office performance, movie genres, studio profitability, and audience ratings.

Source of data;
The datasets were sourced from reputable sources such as Box Office Mojo, IMDb, and Rotten Tomatoes, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the data.

Description of data;
Each dataset contains a wealth of information, including movie titles, release dates, box office revenues, genre classifications, studio affiliations, and audience ratings.

E. Data cleaning
During this process, I dropped unnecesarry columns as well as checked for duplicates.
There was also replacing of null values with statistical figures where applicable.
Some columns needed to be split and exploded for example the genre column as it had more than one genre in each entry which initially affected my bar graph.
After cleaning of my datasets, there was merging of the datasets based on the columns that I needed for analysis and visualization.


F. Visualizations and findings
Based on my visualizations and analysis, it is seen that the drama genre has the highest count and popularity in general meaning Microsoft should focus on production of movies in this Genre.

Another finding is that the fox studio seems to be the most profitable studio in the industry. Hence microsoft should consider maybe forming a partnership with fox studio to get the resources and labour and probably marketing strategies fox uses before starting their own studio from scratch.
This will help them gain some insights on how fox studio carries out their daily operations and probably help microsoft understand why fox studio stands out.

Another finding is that the genres with the highest popularity seem to be the ones that bring more revenue.Hence Microsost could focus on the extremely popular movies and create their own similar to the popular ones to gain traction and revenue significantly.

It was also noticed that Micrsosoft does not need to pay too much attention to runtime of movies as this does not seem to have too much of an effect on the profits.

Conclusion
To sum it up, these insights are of great significance to microsoft when trying to establish their own studio as they can use the fox studio as a great metric of how to operate their studio at the start until they get the right grounding.
Microsoft should also consider venturing into the drama genre as it seems to be the most popular and as seen from our analysis the most popular genre brings the most revenue.

 Three relevant findings
1. Microsoft should consider holding several meetings with fox studio to find a way forward or probably venture into a partnership
2. Microsoft needs to focus on the drama genre in their production.
3. Microsoft needs to create unique productions specifically in the drama genre to maintain and increase popularity that is alrady present in the specific genre for profits.
