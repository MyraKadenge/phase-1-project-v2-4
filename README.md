This hence poses a challenge for the company which is to figure out how to open a profitable studio and explore the films that are currently doing the best, or considered most popular. moreover finding a unique set of films that could give them a unique identity. The most essential thing to do would be to look at the most profitable movies.

##Data Understanding and Analysis
We have collected several datasets containing valuable information related to the movie industry, including data on box office performance, movie genres, studio profitability, and audience ratings.
Source of data
The datasets were sourced from reputable sources such as Box Office Mojo, IMDb, and Rotten Tomatoes, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the data.
Description of data
Each dataset contains a wealth of information, including movie titles, release dates, box office revenues, genre classifications, studio affiliations, and audience ratings.

##Data cleaning
During this process, i dropped unnecesarry columns as well as checked for duplicates.
There was also replacing of null values with statistical figures where applicable.
Some columns needed to be split and exploded for example the genre column as it had more than one genre in each entry which initially affected my bar graph.
After cleaning of my datasets, there was merging of the datasets based on the columns that i needed for analysis and visualization.



Based on my visualizations and analysis, it is seen that the drama genre has the highest count and popularity in general.
